# IM161_Assignment2
This is the repository for the second assignment for Bradley University's IM 161 course, Web Design, taught in the Spring semester of 2023.

My website is about the Triforce, the overarching power over each of the three key characters within the Legend of Zelda Franchise. Each page provides a little bit of information on each of the three parts of the Triforce, and how they relate to one another, along with some facts about them, related to the most recent game in the franchise, _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild._
